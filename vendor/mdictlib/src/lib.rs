//! Library-first parser for MDict `.mdx` and `.mdd` files.
//!
//! MDX and MDD share one defensive, file-backed parsing core. Opening parses
//! bounded metadata and block indexes; key and record blocks remain lazy.
//!
//! Physical ordinals preserve duplicate identity. Global raw-exact lookup wins
//! before header-normalized fallback, and MDD resources can be streamed through
//! source-bound spans. Per-open limits bound untrusted input and parser work.
//! MDX callers may optionally build a bounded, source-bound persistent key
//! index and reopen it through safe lazy positional reads; artifact placement
//! and publication remain caller-owned.
//! MDict wire checksum comparisons are controlled by [`ChecksumPolicy`] and
//! default to [`ChecksumPolicy::Skip`] for throughput; structural parsing and
//! decompression validation remain enabled.
//!
//! # Wire versions
//!
//! MDict major versions 1 and 2 are both read through this API. The version is
//! resolved once, from the header, and selects one grammar; it never reaches
//! lookup, iteration, ordinal access, record decoding, or MDD streaming. A file
//! that fails one grammar is never retried under the other.
//!
//! Version 1 support covers unencrypted files using uncompressed or LZO blocks.
//! Encrypted version 1 files and the ISO8859-1 text label are refused with a
//! precise error rather than parsed speculatively.
